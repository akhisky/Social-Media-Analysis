# Social-Media-Analysis
Explored user engagement and activity distribution to get an overview on how many users have high, moderate and low engagement and activity.
Analysed the tags using SQL queries to check what kind of tags the user possesses with high engagement on their post uses.
Compared the tags of high engagement and low engagement users and found that users with low engagement on their posts use less tags and tags are not popular.
Created a list of users who can be potential influencers by seeing engagement on their posts and tags they have used.
